The Steam Games Dataset provides insights into game popularity, pricing, reviews, and user engagement. The dataset is from kaggle which is based on the data analysis of the Steam platform. This is the source; Steam games Dataset 2025. The dataset contains the categories such as the publisher of games, various ratings given to the games, and some properties of the games themselves like when they were released and their genres. These categories will help us look at things such as how well received a game was, what sort of games a publisher publishes, and  how often a “good” game is released. This data is tidy and upon exploring it, contains no null values. The dataset has over 71k titles, which is a large enough population to see trends throughout our search space for our research questions. Since this data was collected through steam api, the data is accurate and done so ethically as well.

There has been some disappointment for major gaming companies in previous years, making 2025 also a turbulent year for gaming. It would be interesting to analyze how gaming purchases and overall sentiment have trended over the last year. 2024 was an interesting year for gaming, with many instant hits and many flops. Some games have excelled from previously unknown publishers while known publishers continue to create uncreative products. From a visualization perspective, creating visualizations like heatmaps and plotting points showing trends based on ratings, genres, and developers over the time released could provide insight to how 2025 will fare for these companies and what sorta trend of games can we expect for this year. It would be also interesting to visualize user sentiment and see what are the most popular games of the times and what we can learn from such trends, such as popular genres, game features, or what sorta platforms people like.
